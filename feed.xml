It's time to make a summary of what this year was for me at it's various levels. &lt;em&gt;Not that it matters to anyone, but remember, I write it for myself, so bear with me :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Professional&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevScope&lt;/strong&gt; - This year I've left my old job, after more than 8 years, and joined &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.devscope.net"&gt;DevScope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a major change for me, as you can imagine, not only for the company but also for the types of projects I've tackled at this new position. Since the beginning of the year, I've had the opportunity to work on several projects and learn a bunch from a lot of diverse amazing people, which was precisely one of my main motivations for this transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side-projects&lt;/strong&gt; - I give a lot of value to side-projects, for various reasons. Due to a lot of factors, this was a very neglected area in 2016, which does not make me happy, so changes will be expected next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; - This holds a very tight relation to side-projects. Still, I've made a lot of improvements on disparate technologies, as needed on the different projects I collaborated with. 2017 will not be the year in which I will specialize in only one area or technology, that's for certain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://netponto.org"&gt;NetPonto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - With the intent to keep the community alive, I've started helping this community group in 2015 (that year I've helped on 3 meetings at Porto). In 2016 I've managed to help on 5 meetings at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/147281438622/photos/?tab=albums"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt; and 2 more on nearby cities &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/147281438622/photos/?tab=album&amp;amp;album_id=10154023073523623"&gt;Braga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/147281438622/photos/?tab=album&amp;amp;album_id=10154261277338623"&gt;Aveiro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - As this is the only blog post of 2016, I think it's self explanatory. Definitely something to improve in 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media&lt;/strong&gt; - I've started to share more frequently some articles I consider worth reading, even if I don't agree with all of the points, but still consider the main arguments relevant and capable for triggering a conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking&lt;/strong&gt; - I've made a small presentation at &lt;a href="http://www.portodata.net"&gt;Porto.Data&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft Data Platform Community, on &lt;a href="http://www.portodata.net/xxii-evento-porto-data-31-agosto-2016-uptec/"&gt;SQL Server Data Tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Personal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family&lt;/strong&gt; - Keeping up with all the family duties and still have time to relax and enjoy each moment is sometimes a hard task, but being present on the first full year of my child and raising him with my girlfriend-turned-wife is just inexplicably astounding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects&lt;/strong&gt; - A lot of setbacks occurred during the year that postponed some of the personal and family projects we had projected to happen in 2016. Others have been slowly put in place, and a lot more will be starting next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/strong&gt; - This was a tough year for me to exercise routinely, so my weight reflects that. On the other hand, a lot of unplanned exercise took place throughout the year on some home improvement projects. Besides that, chasing around my energetic and strong personality kid &lt;i class="fa fa-heart" style="color:red"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; gives me free mental and physical exercise in a way no other activity can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What to expect in 2017&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will certainly be an amazing year. I have a lot of stuff ahead of me to accomplish in the next 12 months at all of the above contexts. Some of them will be truly challenging, but that's a fantastic way to keep on moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;
One thing worth mentioning is that all of this takes time, so choices and adjustments have to be made along the way in order to have available free time for what's more important in my life, and that is obviously my family and friends. Without them nearby, the items above wouldn't make any sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will your 2017 be like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Of course I'm being a bit extreme here, but if that's your case, please make a comment below, I really would like to know more details on that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NuGet we could easily &lt;em&gt;"add a reference"&lt;/em&gt; to an opensource project, provided it had a NuGet package available, and thus maintain the references updated with a simple action on the UI. That's what helped to drive the .NET development community towards opensource initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So, is NuGet dead?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from it! But despite all the goodness that NuGet brought to the .NET world (or should I say sweetness), some bitterness arises when working with web frontend NuGet packages (either in plain ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC projects).
NuGet packages work great for including compiled external libraries into my projects, so I will definitely continue to use NuGet for the backend stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem with the frontend NuGet packages (CSS and JavaScript) is that when you add them, each one seems to have it's own will, getting scattered all over the project folders, forcing me to find its files in whichever folder it choses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that there is a lack of NuGet packages for a lot of very used JavaScript libraries, which are available for other web development communities, or at least the available packages take longer to be updated. That makes it seem as if the .NET web development community is lagging behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introducing Bower&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with Visual Studio 2015, the recommended method for adding frontend web packages to your projects is using &lt;a href="http://bower.io/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a package manager for the web&lt;/em&gt;, as they call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bower packages get installed to a folder with the name of each package inside a &lt;code&gt;bower_components&lt;/code&gt; folder on the root of your project. No more hunting around the installed files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your team or environment uses other tools besides Visual Studio for web development, Bower brings a more clean path to achieve what others are doing, since it's commonly used amongst web developers from other communities (Node.js, for instance). That also brings a bigger number of available packages, as well as faster updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NuGet or Bower?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I would recommned all server-side packages to be installed with &lt;strong&gt;NuGet&lt;/strong&gt;, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Ninject/"&gt;Ninject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework/"&gt;EntityFramework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit/"&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/log4net/"&gt;log4net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all the &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=microsoft.aspnet"&gt;Microsoft.AspNet&lt;/a&gt; packages (the MVC framework, OWIN, Razor, WebApi, and so on)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you've got the picture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;strong&gt;Bower&lt;/strong&gt;, we stick to the web frontend packages, like the ones below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jquery.com/"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://github.com/twbs/bootstrap"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://angularjs.org/"&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://github.com/angular/angular.js"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://select2.github.io/"&gt;Select2&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://github.com/select2/select2"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.datatables.net/"&gt;DataTables&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://github.com/DataTables/DataTables"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;D3.js&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://github.com/mbostock/d3"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://momentjs.com/"&gt;Moment.js&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://github.com/moment/moment/"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~~On my next blog post, I'll show you how we can add Bower to a Visual Studio project.~~&lt;br /&gt;
EDIT: It turns out that making promises on upcoming unwritten blog posts is not such a good of an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's in it for me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I'm not a SQL Server expert by any means, some of the sessions were just beyond my reach, not that I was afraid of getting my head blown by Paul White (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SQL_Kiwi"&gt;@SQL_Kiwi&lt;/a&gt;), Dejan Sarka (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/DejanSarka"&gt;@DejanSarka&lt;/a&gt;), Mark Broadbent (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/retracement"&gt;@retracement&lt;/a&gt;) or Milos Radivojevic (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MilosSQL"&gt;@MilosSQL&lt;/a&gt;), to name a few SQL &lt;em&gt;superstars&lt;/em&gt; that I skipped this year, but there was so many to choose from and the quality bar was so high that choices had to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the lineup, I've selected the themes with content that I could leverage in the next few months, especially those related to Business Intelligence, one of the current big trends on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sessions I attended were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agile BI - &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SteffLocke"&gt;Stephanie Locke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Amazing Power BI vNext - All about the new version of Power BI! - &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/rquintino"&gt;Rui Quintino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools and Tips: From accidental to efficient Data Warehouse developer - &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cathrinew"&gt;Cathrine Wilhelmsen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PowerBI for Developers - &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/RuiRomano"&gt;Rui Romano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python and R for SQL Server and Business Intelligence: Be a data analysis Rock Star! - &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jenstirrup"&gt;Jen Stirrup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL vNext Business Intelligence - &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/bvbasto"&gt;Bruno Basto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year we had the chance to grasp some real use cases of Power BI (first launched in 2013). This year, Microsoft has shown some &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powerbi/archive/2015/05/08/a-fresh-new-look-for-the-power-bi-preview.aspx"&gt;major improvements&lt;/a&gt; on this platform and started to reveal a development model on top of it (still in the works) which will allow for a lot more possibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another gap that Microsoft was needing to bridge was a solution for cross-platform dashboards, that could be fed by multiple kinds of data sources. I think that is now solved with the &lt;a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/04/14/microsoft-acquires-mobile-business-intelligence-leader-datazen"&gt;acquisition of DataZen&lt;/a&gt; and the inclusion of the product into the SQL Server Enterprise package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's becoming increasingly more difficult to justify some enterprise policies that want to keep organization data outside cloud services, Microsoft Azure is just not stopping to release new gems every other week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new Microsoft embraces all kind of technology we can imagine. One more proof of that is the integration of R in the upcoming SQL Server 2016.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of opportunities for improvement of my skills on solution development within the Microsoft SQL Server stack. The sessions from &lt;a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/369/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=25275"&gt;Stephanie Locke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/369/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=11235"&gt;Cathrine Wilhelmsen&lt;/a&gt; were just amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this one day, a good part of the SQL community throughout the world came together, and if you were around and missed it, to bad for you. But there is hope, because these &lt;a href="http://www.sqlport.com/sql-server/sobre-sqlport"&gt;amazing organizers&lt;/a&gt; are already setting up &lt;a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/429"&gt;SQLSaturday Oporto&lt;/a&gt; for October 3. Go ahead and register now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be asking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"A blog?! That's so outdated, right?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don't believe so, and if you work on any kind of software development, I'm pretty sure you already found some cool solution to a problem you were having on a random guy's blog, and couldn't find it anywhere else on the &lt;em&gt;interwebs&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, &lt;em&gt;random guy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8482; rocks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ok, but aren't there enough blogs, already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of them, of course, but I believe that the Internet has enough room for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you believe that someone will actually read it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will write mainly for myself, so that I can later find the solutions I've once found and meanwhile forgot about. Why keep something like that on your head when you can easily look it up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you're writing for yourself, couldn't you keep it private?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I've learned that if you have a problem or a solution of some sort that you find useful, other people could also relate to that and find usefulness on what you've done. Why keep it all to yourself when you can share it with the community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, those are my viewpoints about blogging, talking to this imaginary and very skeptical person, dear reader and future self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that on future posts you can find something valuable. In the meantime, you can start by following my blog or contact me anytime you want.&lt;/p&gt;
